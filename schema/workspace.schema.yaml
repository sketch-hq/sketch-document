title: Workspace
description:
  The workspace is a folder in the Sketch file archive that can contain
  arbitrary JSON files, allowing Sketch and 3rd party products and tools to
  store settings that should travel with the Sketch document. To avoid clashes
  or settings being overridden, select a unique name for your workspace file. A
  workspace file named `assistants` has been reserved for Sketch Assistant
  settings, and is specified below. Note that custom layer-level data should
  continue to be stored in `userInfo` of these objects, not within the
  workspace.
